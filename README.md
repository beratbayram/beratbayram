# 💫 About Me:

Hi, I’m Berat Bayram, a Front-End Infrastructure Engineer at TÜBİTAK BİLGEM YTE. Since 2022, I’ve been building scalable front-end systems with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Web Components (Lit), focusing on shared component architectures and micro front-ends.

I’ve led custom Next.js setups, designed reusable UI libraries, and contributed to internal training and mentoring. Beyond coding, I help architect tech stacks and guide teams across projects.

My strength lies in crafting robust front-end solutions while collaborating closely with developers and designers. I also bring leadership experience from founding and managing student communities, balancing tech and teamwork with ease.
